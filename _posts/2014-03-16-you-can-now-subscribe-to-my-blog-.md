I've now added a widget on the sidebar that allows you to subscribe to my blog via email!

If you use RSS/Atom, you can also subscribe via [FeedBurner](http://feeds.feedburner.com/calvin-tam-blog) or directly from [my feed]({{page.feed_url}}).

I'm also considering cross-posting to Twitter to make it easier for those who prefer a more summarised feed.
