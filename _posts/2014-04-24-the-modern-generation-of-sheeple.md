First let's begin with what is meant by 'sheeple': *people who are unable to think for themselves*.
We've all met them before, characterised by their total willingness to accept the status quo, accept what is taught as the ultimate truth and unable to form an independent opinion.

Having leaped from teaching high school students by the class a few years ago, I'm currently teaching/tutoring university students for an introductory computer science course.
The sad thing is these (mainly) first-year students still carry the same 'follow the herd' mantra from high school: do as you're told, never question the teacher and your education is all about regurgitating facts for the final exam.

As a teacher, I find myself with the responsibility to not only ensure my students digest what is learnt from lectures, but most importantly to develop their motivation to learn. I've seen too many so-called 'teachers' which are really just repeating the same mundane content in front totally disengaged students. That is not teaching, that is regurgitating.

Now let's look into some specific points with anecdotal experiences: 

1. **Unable to take the leap in problem solving**

    A student was stuck on a lab problem. Alright let's start the process:

    > "What's the problem?"

    > "I don't know"

    > "Let me rephrase that, what is the one thing that is stopping you from solving the problem?"

    > "I don't know"

    > "Hang on but you just told me you had a problem"

    > "Yeah, but I don't know where to start"

    The inability of the student to think logically and identify what and where the problem is, is a big impediment to their learning. Note how I'm not saying that finding the solution straight away is the key, the point is that they need to know what the problem is in the first place so they can find the right kind of *help*.

2. **Lack of patience**

    Typically when I run debugging sessions with students, instead of immediately telling them the answer, I much prefer to invest a bit of time to question them and let them answer their own question:

    > "Calvin, I know there's a bug here"

    > "Cool why don't you tell me what the problem is then?"

    > "Nah I couldn't find it"

    > "Have you tried printing things?"

    > "Yeah nothing is wrong"

    > "Have you run it through the debugger step by step?"

    > "No I haven't, I don't have time. Can you just hurry up and tell me the answer?"

    > "No I can't that would defeat the purpose of this exercise then right? Try debugging it step-by-step and I guarantee you will find something"

    > "...(5 minute later) Wow! Calvin I found it, thanks"

    Note that I did not give the answer to the student, rather I provided the tools for the student to find the answer for himself.
    Students have very little patience, not helped by the fact that in primary and secondary school they are not trained to persevere in difficult situations.

3. **Blind trust**

    Students will generally accept everything they are taught in lectures. They do not question the material at all. The focus of high school and university for them merely becomes regurgitating that information precisely and not to actually learn and *expand* beyond the material.

    A student once asked me:

    > "The lecturer said writing 'int main (void)' for the main function was fine (instead of 'int main (int argc, char *argv[]))'"

    > "Right for the purposes of this course, I can understand why he would say that, but do you know *why* he did that?"

    > "Nah it's right if he does it"

    The amount of blind trust that students place on lecturers is astounding.
    A good student will always question everything, and only through that will he/she learn to separate garbage from truth.
    When one extrapolates their behaviour into their future lives, they become 'sheeple' who will just follow what the media portrays the truth rather than what their own perspective tells them.

4. **Regurgitation**

    I'm the type of teacher that dislikes spoon-feeding information to students only to have them regurgitate it for a final exam. It is the process of struggling through the material, with a bit of guidance from tutors and teachers, more struggling and internalisation of the material through practice does a student truly learn from the experience. Regurgitating information for assignments and exams is great for consistent marking, but not all that great for life-long learning practices. We as teachers should focus on building a foundation of motivation in students *first* before proceeding to the technical material.

    Perhaps the saddest of all points, a student once said to me:

    > "Calvin, to do well in this course I just need to memorise the lecture code samples and write it out for the finals right?"

    Clearly this was the first time the student was doing a computer science course and never had experience programming, so from her high school experience she extrapolated that programming was merely to "memorise".
    It really saddens me with the way students are taught from a very young age that this is the norm.

**Conclusion**

I'm deeply disappointed with the current education system that puts its focus in the wrong areas, and instead should focus on developing motivation in students, which is far superior from spoon-feeding students into becoming 'sheeple'.
