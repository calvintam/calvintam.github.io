In psychology there is a theory called '*critical contacts theory*' (Harn & Thornton; Ralston & Brady, 1994), which suggests that a candidate's assessment of the offer is highly influenced by what happens during the interview process and the actions of those who represent the recruiting party.
In my experience, I've found this theory to be quite in tune with how I've felt about the experience and the ultimate decision to accept/decline the offer.

Provided that I have primarily dealt with HR within the tech industry, I've left the title to target the tech industry because I can't say for sure (from experience) whether this is the case in other industries.

However I'm sure (most of) what I say below can equally apply to other industries though.

So now let's go into specific things that HR just are not doing right:

1. **Lack of domain knowledge**
    * Recruiters in the tech industry typically (by typically I mean closer to 99%) have no domain knowledge. This can be topics regarding software engineering best practices, programming languages, latest tech trends. The importance of domain knowledge cannot be understated given the recruiter is the first point of contact with the candidate. A good candidate can easily tell from a quick chat with the recruiter whether or not they know tech when all they can do is throw buzzwords that have very little meaning. 
        * Example: recruiter is calling a candidate regarding an 'exciting Web Developer role' but not being able to discern the difference between Java and JavaScript.
        * Example: recruiter is made to do the initial phone screen, and is provided with multiple choice/written solutions to a simple 'technical' question such as 'what is the most efficient way to find a number in a sorted array?'. Treat the candidate with respect, let HR deal with the personality quiz and an engineer for the technical screening.

1. **Infrequent, vague, impersonal communication**
    * Infrequent: This is an extremely irritating one. Recruiters are terrible at letting the candidate know what's going on. All it takes is a short email which only takes <5 minutes to write saying what your current progress is in the interviewing pipeline. Heck if it takes that much effort, automate it with an online progress tracker of sorts.
    * Vague: Even simple misunderstandings like what day is meant by 'next week' can add up to the frustration. Be explicit and keep it simple. 
    * Impersonal: HR recruiters are known for sending emails that are obviously just canned responses. Typically used for cold-calling or for pre-interview preparation. It is entirely understandable that HR have to deal with many candidates and hence don't have time to write personalized emails. However for things like pre-interview preparation, at least make sure the canned material that you are sending is not outdated and is checked before sending.
        * Example: big software company tells recruiter to send canned email that they've been using for > 5 years, but in reality the interview only covers 50% of what is mentioned. The so-called 'useful resources' do not help at all.

1. **Tardiness**
    * Pre-onsite interviews: Recruiters can absolutely be relied upon... to be late. Late phone calls that keep you waiting. Late scheduling of meetings. There's always an excuse that 'I was in a meeting'. Respect the candidate's time. If you are running late, always send a quick email to tell them that is the case. And even then, perhaps your schedule is too packed.
    * Onsite interivews: Same thing applies with onsite. HR will always make you wait uncomfortably in the lobby or reception area for > 15 min. The worst that I have ever had was a 75 minute late turnout. Beat that :P. Have a schedule and set reminders please!
1. **Treating candidates like numbers**
    * Recruiters are under pressure to present X candidates for the initial pool, and also Y candidates to be screened, and finally with downward pressure to meet this year's quota of hires. Stop treating candidates like a number and treat them like a person. If you're going to use the excuse that "Sorry due to the number of spots we have left, we can't hire you", perhaps HR should have a good look at themselves and understand where the problem is when the candidate is good but your not able to hire.
1. **Being unprepared**
    * Time and time again, recruiters will come up to an onsite interview unprepared - forgetting the exact interview times for the day, who is responsible for the first interview, who is scheduled to interview, forgetting to get new whiteboard markers, etc. The candidate has spent time preparing for the interview, so should the recruiter. 


HR recruiters are really ruining the experience in the tech industry. 
I have only ever met **1** (yes that's a one) recruiter who was the opposite of what I said above: she was punctual, followed up with me promptly after interviews, clearly communicated the offer, and treated my time as valuable by ensuring the process was as short as possible.
My brief experience with her suggested she took HR seriously, she believed in continued education and took psychology as an integral part of her work.
Unfortunately I've not met another recruiter of similar calibre, and I hope that the HR industry reflects carefully on how they can better do their job.
