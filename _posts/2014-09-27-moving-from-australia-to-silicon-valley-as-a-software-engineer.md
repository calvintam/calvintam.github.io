I recently moved from Sydney to Palo Alto, California to be a software engineer at Groupon.
This is a post on the practical advice I would have given to myself at the start.
It's in the spirit of Nicolas Gallagher's similar post [Moving from London to San Francisco](http://nicolasgallagher.com/moving-from-london-to-san-francisco-as-a-software-engineer/) which in turn was in the spirit of Ian Chan's [Tutorial: Moving from Canada to America as a software developer](http://chanian.com/2010/08/01/tutorial-moving-from-canada-to-america-as-a-software-developer/).


#Banking
##Get no-fee debit/credit cards back home
To prevent per-transaction currency conversion fees, I highly recommended getting the Citibank Transaction Plus/ 28Degrees Mastercard combo back in Australia.
The Citibank Transaction Plus account is pretty amazing, no minimum balance, no international transaction fees, no annual fee and it uses Visa for currency conversion.
It's a debit card which is great if you want to spend your own money and/or buying expensive things.
On the other hand if you want to use a credit card, pick the 28Degrees Mastercard.
Similar to the Citibank card, it has no international transaction fees, no annual fees, but it uses Mastercard for currency conversion.
These cards will come in handy for the first month when you finances are in a mess, and can temporarily help you with setting up online accounts, buying from Amazon, or even for withdrawing cash.

##Open a checking account asap
Finance is probably **the** most important thing once you move to a new country.
So once you get off the plane, catch a taxi to the nearest bank to open a checking account so that you can receive funds from friends and work and stop haemorrhaging the exorbitant international transaction and/or currency conversion losses.
I went to Citibank to open a checking account so that I could transfer funds back home to my Australian Citibank account without incurring international wire transfer fees.

I also opened a Bank of America checking account and was issued a temporary debit card.
This is really important because now you can use the card for online purchases.

Note: make sure to make your mailing address somewhere more permanent, i.e. your workplace instead of your one-month temporary corporate housing.

Note: bring some secondary ID such as your driver's license as they'll ask for proof of residential address

##Get a credit card, build credit history
Coming to the USA as a foreigner means you don't have carried over credit history (unless you have a banking relationship that allows for transfer of history within that bank) and plus you non-resident status makes it extremely difficult to get started on credit cards.
Now the USA economy is heavily reliant on credit, so without a credit history you basically can't get a loan anywhere and setting up utilities accounts become a hassle.
So it's crucial to start building your credit history asap.
I went to the Bank of America to get a Cash Rewards Credit Card using my offer letter as proof of income, though since I didn't have an SSN to go with it the only way to do it is by the slow paper application.


#Communication
The second most important thing after finances, is communication.

##Get a mobile plan
If you're like me and you're a tech worker, you basically can't live without your phone and the Internet.
I got a T-mobile sim that is $30/month prepaid and gives you 100 minutes of calls, unlimited text, 5GB of 4G data and unlimited 2G data.
Because I use more data than calls, this was the perfect plan (plus if you need to make more calls, just use VoIP apps such as GrooVe IP and Talkatone).
It is fairly confusing getting this particular sim (just check it up online and you'll know what I mean).
Setup "Autoload" and you won't have to worry about the plan afterwards.
You can only get it at [Walmart](http://www.walmart.com/ip/T-Mobile-Micro-SIM-Activation-Kit/24099996)
Having the ability to get Google maps and search within reach at all times is a life saver when you're in a unknown place.


#Transportation
##Get a Clipper card
I guess I'm lucky that I get a GoPass as a part of my workplace benefits so I get free rides on the Caltrain, but definitely still get the Clipper card which allows you to travel on public transportation in the SF Bay Area.
In my case, I found it most useful for use on the VTA buses since they don't provide change (you don't wanna hop onto a bus with just a $50 note, otherwise it'll be an expensive bus ride).

##Ride sharing
Uber and Lyft are doing great work competing with the taxi industry.
If you ever need a ride to somewhere not close to public transportation, they are your friend.
It also beats calling a taxi and have to somehow tell them to meet you at a particular location that you're not familiar with, and then to have to pay cash or worse, credit card for the ride.
The cool thing with Uber/Lyft is you will sign up with a credit/debit card upfront and then use the mobile app to call for a ride (it uses your location tracking to find you!) and gives you updates on a map about where your driver is.
At the end of the ride, no cash needed to be dished out since payments are done automatically at the end of the ride via the app.
Check for promotions and company benefits on getting ride credit with either company (I got $25 credit with Lyft this way and $30 with Uber).

##Get a bike/car
There are going to be lots of place that you want to go that is not reachable with public transportation, so invest in either a bike or car.
In Palo Alto, there are plenty of bike lanes and a bustling bike culture so a bike is a real good investment here for hauling groceries and running other errands.


#Identity and documentation
##Get a Social Security Number
The SSN is **the** biggest form of identification in terms of taxes, benefits, medicare, and banking.
It is typically used by employers for the "E-Verify" program that verifies your eligibility to work in the USA, so your employer will most likely hassle you to get asap anyway.
Official guidelines says to wait 10 days after arrival before applying for the SSN, but generally that's on the safe side to ensure the government departments update their records for verification.
I went 6 days after I entered into the states and didn't have any problems on application.
Make sure to go to a Social Security Administration office before it opens to get a ticket early, otherwise the office gets extremely busy (plus they only open Mon-Fri and close early).
You typically will wait 1 hour before being served, and just provide the required identification (a passport was sufficient).
It is crucial you get your SSN asap, without it basically can't do anything in the states.

##Keep your passport on your at all times
Always keep your passport with you because it serves to verify your identity until you can get a California ID card, it underpins anything related to banking, government, renting and employment.
Also useful to have if you're going to a bar and look fairly young, as you're probably going to be asked to show ID.


#Accommodation
##Renting
Do your research when it comes to finding a place to rent.
Yelp typically have some reviews which give you a good insight into whether the place is not as advertised or suited to your needs.
The price of renting is very high mainly because of the influx of tech workers in the SF Bay Area, so be prepared to pay >$2000/month just to get a half-decent studio/1 bedroom apartment that's unfurnished.
Rent.com is your friend here, it'll provide you will some tools to search within neighbourhoods and also offer a $100 reward if you sign a lease with a place and note that you were referred by rent.com.
Be open-minded and check out the other apartments in the vicinity of Rent.com-listed apartments while you're there already touring.
If you're unable to coordinate housing for whatever reason, Airbnb is a really good option for short stays.


#Welcome to the United States of America
It's been quite a ride moving over to Silicon Valley, and sure it's a lot of hassle to setup things that you would have taken for granted back at home but it also broadens your experience and gives you a chance to try lots of new things.
Looking forward to the good food and picturesque natural surroundings here in the SF Bay Area!
