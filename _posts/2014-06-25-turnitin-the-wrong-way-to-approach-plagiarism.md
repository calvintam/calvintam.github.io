Turnitin is widely used across many universities as an academic plagiarism checker and has quickly become the primary, rather than secondary, tool to detect plagiarism in assignments.
Traditionally, plagiarism checking has largely been ineffective when markers have had to plough through essays manually and using weak heuristics to 'sniff out' commonplace plagiarism practices: awkward argument flow, overly academic vocabulary, etc.

On the other hand, Turnitin uses text-matching to detect possible cases of plagiarism, checking against a massive database for similar instances of phrases. 
This form of plagiarism checking is effective in catching the simple copy-and-paste type plagiarism but is otherwise ineffective for other, more sophisticated types of plagiarism.
Though Turnitin explicitly disclaims that Turnitin should be used only as a tool and not the ultimate plagiarism determinant, many universities/academics have basically used it as the core determinant of plagiarism.

In one of my university courses, the lecturer had setup Turnitin for submission, but refused to allow the students to check the similarity score provided by Turnitin, stating somewhere on the lines of "_I'm not releasing it so I can catch those who are plagiarising, if you haven't there's nothing to worry about_".
The students said that in previous courses where Turnitin was used, it was common practice for students to submit a draft, check that it was not setting off 'false positives', and refining their work to reduce the likelihood of being accused of plagiarism.
You might then ask: "_But wouldn't people who cheat just submit multiple times, until it didn't register with a high similarity score?_".

Bingo. That's the point.

Even if the student intended to perform plagiarism but knowing that Turnitin detected it as plagiarism, they would be forced to redo their essay in order for it to not trigger.
To this end, Turnitin has **prevented** plagiarism.
However, when this lecturer refused to release the similarity score, he is trying to **catch** plagiarists rather than preventing plagiarism.

Is this sending out the right message for plagiarism?

From a moral absolutist position, it would seem absolutely correct to not reveal the similarity score: if the student didn't cheat, they would not have to worry.
But what if a false positive was encountered?
How should the student defend their position?

It is undeniable that academics would have some bias for a popular plagiarism checker that is used by everyone else.
It also presents paranoia to the students that actually put the effort in and try to combine arguments retrieved from sources but fear their wording is not good enough and could be viewed as plagiarism.
This side-effect of paranoia is simply not worth it for the chance of catching the small percentage of cheaters.

Instead I'd argue from a utilitarian point of view and say that instead of a system of 'punishing', we move towards a system where we present the diminished utility of plagiarism, where to plagiarise is to waste time because Turnitin will detect it and so doing it right the first time without cheating and you do yourself and the marker a favour.

Universities/academics mistakenly view Turnitin as a deterrent, but don't necessarily see the parallels it has with illicit drug control/mandates that governments pour copious amounts of funding in with very little effectiveness in solving the problem, instead we should pause and think of sending the message that plagiarism is 'not worth it'.
Having students internalise this anti-plagiarism concept instead of putting in place an external 'punishing' force (marker/ plagiarism board) is far more effective and makes their university educational experience a more guided experience in the lead up to the 'real world' rather than yet-another-policed-state.
