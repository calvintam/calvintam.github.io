## Developing Android Apps
Udacity recently partnered with Google to bring the "[Developing Android Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853)" online course, which as of today has >58,000 students.
The course is taught by Google engineers and is administered via short, succinct YouTube video segments.
What's interesting about the Udacity platform is that it isn't just hosting YouTube videos and expect students to 'magically' follow along.
Instead they've added some interactivity via mini-quizzes, which range from choosing from a set of radio button answers, text input, label the order of the following, etc.

One of my peeves for doing MOOCs are videos that basically give the answer to you and then forces you to do the quiz as though it was an rhetorical question to keep you awake.
You learn absolutely nothing with that approach.
Switch back to Udacity, and I found it interesting that they reversed that: ask you the question **first**, and point you to external links (typically the official Android documentation).
Then only after attempting at the quiz are you then directed to the recorded solution.
I really liked this approach, it gave just enough friction to encourage students to search for the solution online for a bit and only when they couldn't get way would they then opt to check the solutions.

Having recently just completed the course, I can it's a really nice way to break into Android app development.
Concepts such as intents, app lifecycle, and fragments were well explained in the context of the framework and related design decisions.
I really enjoyed learning about the historical nuances and the architecture of the Android framework and this really provide the right motivation to learn these concepts (rather than a simple brush-off of "don't worry, this is just some magic here").
Would highly recommend to existing developers who have strong knowledge of Java.

## Nanodegrees
The context of the new course launches coincided with the launch of Udacity's Nanodegree, a unique and practical approach at tackling the issue of computer science education to fill the job demands of the modern tech era.
My understanding of the nanodegree is a drastic shortening of degree length (1-2 years instead of a traditional uni education of 4-6 years) coupled with a focus on real, industry-wide, practical knowledge and skills.
This is a bold and gutsy take on solving the technical skills shortage apparent in the industry.
It's flexible enough to cater for a broad spectrum of education:

* **Curious upskiller, but only if it's free** - Udacity provides access to most of the educational material of each course for **free**, allowing anyone on the internet who is interested enough to essentially take the course without feedback. Still great to be able to have full access to the video content!
* **Serious job hunter, needs structure and guidance** - in parallel to the free course content offering, Udacity provides course 'coaches' that provide tailored feedback on progress and the ability to be awarded a certificate of completion (after verification via a video call interview)
* **Major career change, needs to learn the fundamentals but doesn't want to go back to uni** - the relative short timeframe to complete the 'tracks', which are composed of several selected courses, give a significantly cheaper alternative to going back to uni to get a computer science degree.

In my opinion, the latter is perhaps the most empowering, the idea that an education that has legitimacy in that Udacity have partnered with industry leaders to create the courses and that the expected completion time is flexible to your schedule.
My hope is that this sets the ball rolling where we rethink what it means to be qualified to work in the tech industry: skills not degrees.
