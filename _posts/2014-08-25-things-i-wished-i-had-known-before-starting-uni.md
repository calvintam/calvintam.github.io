I've finally graduated with a computer science degree!
And once a semester starts, many people will post up questions regarding degree transfers and career pathways on the CSESoc facebook group.
One particular post asked what would be the ways to build a career in the software engineering industry, specifically: how does one get their **first** internship with little or no experience.

It's quite clear that this is not just a problem in the tech industry, and is easily observable in professions such as being a chef or being a lawyer, where somehow amidst the chicken-and-egg problem, one must find their first internship so as to build up a reputable resume.
This sparked me to ruminate for the past few weeks over the pieces of advice/knowledge I would have given to my old self addressing this problem in retrospect, and that this might be useful for anyone in a similar situation.

_Heads-up: this is an extremely long post that might take you a good hour to read, it is basically my life story post-high school ;)_

But first a bit of semi-chronological context and then some advice mixed in:


**Be flexible with your university education**

I began uni with a combined BEng (Mechatronics)/BSci (Computer Science), with the intention of making my mark in artificial intelligence and robotics by eventually doing a PhD and going through the academia track.
This was a 5 year degree which seemed quite daunting (still is :P), but it was a good investment for my intended career.
However, 1.5 years into my degree and doing primarily engineering subjects (and enough computer science subjects to be on track) I was really put off by the many old-fashioned and unmotivated teaching styles present in traditional engineering subjects. 

I decided to take the leap to go with what I found most interesting and dropped the engineering degree, and pursue only the computer science degree.
Part of the reason for the move was the inspirational Richard Buckland of whom I was lucky enough to be in 2 of his core computer science classes.
Those were of the few classes I actually **enjoyed** going to class and felt that I was actually learning and pushing myself.
Thankfully computer science at UNSW is primarily elective-based which meant I was one of the few lucky ones that did not result in a longer time of degree completion.

_TLDR: Degree plans change dramatically from what you thought was definite in high school. Pick your degree wisely to give flexibility and as always, follow your interests._


**Computer science is not for the faint of heart**

So having switched to the single computer science degree, I'm already half way through a 3 year degree!
This was quite a shocking realisation that I was going to graduate very soon, and I felt a strong need to score an internship soon otherwise I would be behind the pack (although UNSW administers computer science degrees under engineering, it is a science degree and so does not require a work placement in order to graduate. However my belief is that if you don't have an internship when you apply for graduate jobs, good luck).

Now I was always fond of technology but never really programmed at an early age (unlike most prodigy programmers), so at that 1.5 year mark of a singularly focused degree, I really felt behind (even though in high school I did relatively well, that didn't necessarily translate to the computer science world).
When I say 'behind' I don't equate that with 'marks', that's a rather crude proxy for judging how comfortable you are with the subject.
Instead it's that feeling that everyone else seems to be faster at reaching a solution than you and that the front-row students seem to know so much more than you (e.g. asks the specifics of a red-black tree when the class is only up to linked lists).
It was only towards the 2 year mark did things begin to feel more second nature and that I felt I was going to have a decent chance of breaking into the top tier of the cohort.

_TLDR: Computer science is not an easy degree to go for, especially for newcomers to programming. A high test score in high school does not correlate with success in university-level computer science. That being said, it's an extremely rewarding career choice IMHO._


**Getting your first internship is always the hardest**

Not having much particular programming experience in the past, applying for software-related internships was going to be tough.
I did however work as a tutor at a tutoring centre for 2 years after high school, so by the time I was applying for internships, I was able to leverage that experience on my resume.
I attended careers fairs specific to the Computer Science and Engineering school and found that they were far more useful than the generic uni wide careers expo.
There I was able to hit every counter, talking to the company representatives and learn which were offering internships that were interesting and would also be practical for me to get in.

In that degree transition phase, I was offered 2 positions at different divisions at the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) and a position at Amadeus IT Pacific.
In the end I picked Amadeus because I felt the need to understand what working in the software industry was like (instead of a government department where IT is just another branch), so I negotiated with Amadeus to hold on the offer for 9 months before starting in the summer.
And that was how I scored my first internship (woohoo!).

_TLDR: Advice to fresh high school grads: get a part-time job, that's your first step to proving you can work in a team and that you are self-motivated. Bootstrap casual jobs until you can find your first career-related internship and from then on it's smooth sailing._


**Industry is completely different from university**

Amadeus' internships are 6-12 months full-time internships, however I wasn't particularly keen on spending another year at uni so I was fortunately enough to have a UNSW alumni as my boss and he gave the ok for 3 months full-time over the summer and then 3 months part-time during semester.
In that 6 month period I learnt a hella lot: managing a global team of software engineers is a tough gig, software is a booming industry, and I learnt that building software solutions for clients is one of the toughest jobs to get right.
Sure I learnt lots of technical stuff like how to use version control, work with proprietary API's, and using Atlassian's Jira SDK, but to me the most valuable thing I got out of the experience was that **the software industry was completely different from university**.

University to me was primarily (not all) lecturers who had never worked in industry (having only been pure academics) and were so detached from industry that what was taught in the classrooms did not translate well to the real-world.
I definitely felt the theory taught played a large part as the foundation for practical skills, but there was definitely not enough practical skills courses that at least attempted to prepare the modern student for the workforce.

_TLDR: In my first internship, I learnt that industry is completely different from university, it's entirely up to you to learn whatever you need to get the job done._


**Internships are for you to know what you like and dislike**

At the conclusion of my Amadeus internship, which was 2.5 years into my degree, I was looking to gain even more experience with another internship.
Now take note that I was after another internship when surely I was about to graduate?!
Remember that I negotiated a part-time deal with Amadeus, so for that semester I underloaded and did a special project with the UNSW Robocup team.
This meant my degree got extended by another 0.5 year, i.e. I had another summer before graduating.
This time I was keen on experiencing a startup environment and shifting towards a "no external clients" business model.
At that point in time having the internship under my belt, my resume was now at a stage were it would finally raise the interest of HR as a solid candidate at the more competitive companies.
I received interview requests from Microsoft, Atlassian, and Freelancer.com.
Freelancer gave me an offer straight after the 4 hour interview and so without really hesitating I accepted their offer, and started working during the winter break.

Freelancer was quite an experience, it definitely had a completely different vibe to Amadeus.
I remember walking in there on my first day with the bewilderment of the plethora of large >27" monitors that everyone had, with the live server statistics monitor ticking away in real-time.
There really was a sense of urgency and buzz (in a good way!).
This was a far-cry from Amadeus which was more of a traditional IBM-like corporate environment, whereas Freelancer was really as I pictured as a Silicon Valley-style startup.

To give a more direct comparison, at Amadeus I was provided with a stock standard Windows 7 PC with two small 19" monitors and your typical HP keyboard, while at Freelancer they bought me a fresh high-end custom built desktop: Intel i7 Quad-core 3GHz+ processor, 16GB of RAM, two ridiculously massive 30" Dell monitors, a Razer DeathAdder Gaming mouse and my first ever mechanical keyboard (Das Keyboard Model S Professional)!
(side note: for the first time I was asked what distro of linux to boot my computer with. I later learnt there was at least 4 distros of linux being used for devs and servers, Mac OSX for the designers only, and Windows for one dev who shall not be named :P)
I must admit that setup really impressed me and really made me wonder whether I was working or at a LAN party.

Now at Freelancer it was a completely different ball-game, having never learnt web-related stuff properly I spent most of my free time learning as much HTML, CSS, JavaScript as I could as I was primarily doing front-end dev work at the time, but thankfully the backend stuff I worked on later used Python of which I was fairly comfortable with then.
I quickly learned that I really enjoyed working on high-traffic websites and a company that really had an impactful product, which suited my tastes more so than client work alone.

_TLDR: In my second internship, I learnt what I liked and disliked, which are both important when deciding what kind of career you want when you graduate._


**The modern software industry is a meritocracy**

All good things come to an end.
Though I genuinely enjoyed interning at Freelancer, full-time study was starting to catch up on me.
My boss at the time was completely flexible with me and gave me room by allowing me to work part-time during semester.
But a bit after midway into semester, I felt it was better to focus on finishing studies first so although Freelancer offered for me to continue part-time and even give first preference for returning in the summer, I grudgingly declined and said my farewells.
Now with two internships under the belt, I felt I had a much better understanding of what it means to be a software engineer and definitely felt that focusing on the singular computer science degree was one of the best decisions I've made.

Next up I started the interview process with Google and Optiver.
To make this short and sweet I'll basically say that Google took forever to schedule phone interviews, so by the time those were completed and they started talking about a possible placement I had already happily accepted Optiver, who presented an offer the day after interviews.
So I didn't end up returning to Freelancer and started interning at Optiver for the summer.
There I rotated across several different teams working on several different projects.

Again I learnt a hella lot here: what high-frequency trading is and their associated technical difficulties, how finicky it is to keep a high-throughput and high-availability network (learnt to admire the hax abilities of DevOps/site reliability engineers) and that the software industry is a meritocracy.
That final point was perhaps the more pertinent out of this experience, the message I got from working there was that software engineers do not follow the traditions of other professions that are plagued by an artificial hierarchy/bureaucracy.
So long you had an evidence-backed opinion, your voice was heard.
No more politics or red-tape to jump through when all you want is to be heard and contribute to the company.
The secondary effect of this was that the interns were able to contribute at a substantially significant level, i.e. we weren't just given 'kiddy' or mundane jobs, we were given full responsibility on the first day as though we were a full-time dev.

_TLDR: In my third internship, I learnt that the software industry is seriously 'the' place to be, and that most workplaces work as a meritocracy. I'm mightily grateful my career has headed in this direction._


**Be prepared before you graduate**

At the end of my third internship, I began what would be my final semester of my now 3.5 year computer science degree.
This meant I had to go through the arduous graduate interviewing process.
Knowing that I would be due to graduate soon, Optiver extended a graduate offer on the last day of my internship and I remember thinking to myself: "wow I did it".
I could not have been more impressed with the internship experience at Optiver, I learnt so much from the smart people there and here they were presenting an offer in black and white and giving me the room to think it over the semester.
(side note: Optiver HR is one of only few tech companies in Sydney that have a proactive HR team who are truly keen on finding top tech talent, the only other one I can think of is Atlassian, with the big G being the worse of all).

Knowing it was graduate recruitment season, they provided time for me to think over the offer and regularly touched up on my status.
In my opinion, a good tech company always puts the candidate first and respects their wishes, instead of pressuring them to an acceptance deadline.
I should add that good tech companies with a **long-term vision** are those that tend to do this, because they understand that even when a candidate doesn't accept, they know they will do good-will recommendations to other people with a good recruiting experience in mind.

In preparation for graduate recruitment season, I did all the necessary research for application opening and closing deadlines and sent away applications to companies that interested me.
At this point I was a lot more confident in my applications because I had already done my research regarding technical interviews, i.e. 5 hour long programming, technical topics quizzing, project/portfolio discussions and whiteboarding.
I'd also been brushing up on these interviewing techniques and questions on an on-off basis for a year prior to doing grad applications.
This meant that when time came to actually do technical interviews, I knew exactly what to study up and practise on.

Just as I'm about to interview with the big tech companies, I get an unsolicited ping from Groupon via Linkedin.
Surprisingly they strategically came over to Australia to recruit much earlier than other tech companies so I was extended an offer much earlier than expected.
Since the presented offer was coming from Silicon Valley, it was going to outrun anything Sydney companies could offer, so the decision was made!
So I went ahead and cancelled other interviews and focused on getting my visa sorted out.

_TLDR: Do your prep work before going into grad interviews. Study technical interview books well in advance of the actual interviews. I recommended starting at least 6 months in advance, accounting for the likelihood of a lack of motivation and/or sudden increases in workload._


**The US tech scene is hot, keep your Linkedin updated**

I never expected to move to the states to work at a tech company but since the offer came, hey why not?
Once your Linkedin profile is sizing up well, recruiters **do** notice and will contact you if they're interested.
In my undergraduate experience, even in the lukewarm tech scene in Sydney and having not graduated, I was still getting a handful of requests.
Not bad at all for a rookie.

However in the US, tech recruiting is a different thing altogether, and so I did a small experiment.
Within 2 days of changing my location to the San Francisco Bay Area I already started getting some requests, which affirms the fact that there is a shortage of top tech talent in the US.
(side note: recruiters in the US ping potential candidates to the point that software engineers block requests just because there are so many of them).

_TLDR: Keep your options open. The US needs lots of top tech talent. Linkedin is your friend once you've built some solid experience._


**Finally, the conclusion** 

I'm really looking forward to working in the states and in particular diving right into the middle of the Silicon Valley tech scene.
For someone who started out having no programming experience prior to university, I can definitely encourage those daunted by the idea of a career in software engineering that it's perfectly doable if your interests lie in solving hard problems and have the perseverance to learn whatever you need to get the job done.

This has been one of the longest blog posts I've ever made, but I hope that this serves not as a universal guideline but an honest experience that you can relate to.
